# Custom Power BI Chatbot with OpenAI Integration

## Overview
We have developed a **Custom Power BI Chatbot** leveraging **OpenAI's GPT technology** to read, analyze, and provide actionable insights over your data directly within Power BI. This integration allows users to interact with their datasets in a conversational manner, ask insightful questions, and receive accurate explanations and recommendations on data trends, all without leaving Power BI.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Insights**: The chatbot processes data from various sources (e.g., Excel, databases) and generates comprehensive insights, explaining trends, changes, and patterns in an easily digestible format.
- **Natural Language Interaction**: Users can interact with their data using natural language queries. The AI interprets user inputs and provides relevant insights, making data analysis more accessible for everyone.
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: The chatbot suggests the next best actions based on data analysis, helping users make informed decisions based on real-time data.
- **Embedded in Power BI**: Seamlessly integrated into Power BI, the chatbot operates directly within the environment, enhancing your data reporting experience without the need for external tools or platforms.

## How It Works
1. **Data Source Integration**: The chatbot connects to your Power BI data sources (such as Excel files, SQL databases, or any other integrated data source).
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Once connected, users can ask questions related to the data, such as "Why did sales drop this month?" or "What factors influenced the increase in user engagement?"
3. **Data Insights & Recommendations**: The AI analyzes the data, identifies key patterns, and offers insights. It also provides contextual recommendations on next steps or further actions to take based on the analysis.
4. **Embedded Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot via an embedded Power BI visual, making it easy to ask questions and receive answers in real-time.

## Benefits
- **Increased Efficiency**: Quickly obtain data-driven insights without manually diving into charts or reports.
- **Data Accessibility**: Empower users across all levels of the organization to access critical insights without requiring advanced data analysis skills.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive immediate, relevant answers to data-related questions as soon as they arise.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the chatbot to answer specific questions relevant to your organization's data and needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Power BI Desktop (latest version)
- OpenAI API credentials for integration
- Data source access (Excel, SQL Server, or any other supported data sources)

### Installation
1. **Import Custom Visual**: Import the custom Power BI visual into your Power BI report.
2. **Connect Data Sources**: Connect your data sources (Excel, SQL, etc.) to the Power BI report.
3. **Configure OpenAI Integration**: Set up the OpenAI API connection to enable natural language interaction.
4. **Deploy the Chatbot**: Embed the chatbot in your report and start interacting with it.

## Usage
1. Once your data sources are connected and the OpenAI integration is configured, open your Power BI report.
2. Type natural language queries into the chatbot visual to interact with your data. Examples of questions include:
    - "Why did sales drop this month?"
    - "What factors influenced the increase in user engagement?"
    - "What should be my next best action based on this data?"

## Example Queries
